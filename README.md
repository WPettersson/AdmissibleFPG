AdmissibleFPG
=============

Java library to determine if face pairing graphs are admissible.


Note that you will also need the LibTW library. This library was originally taken from http://www.treewidth.com but it requires a few modifications and bugfixes to work, so check out https://github.com/WPettersson/libtw/
