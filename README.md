AdmissibleFPG
=============

Java library to determine if face pairing graphs are admissible.


Note that you will also need the LibTW library. This library was originally taken from http://www.treewidth.com but it requires a few modifications and bugfixes to work, so check out https://github.com/WPettersson/libtw/

Usage
============

Once you have the .jar file, you can check for admissibility by running

     java -jar AdmissibleFPG.jar pairs.file

where <code>pairs.file</code> is a file containing a list of face-pairing graphs as generated by tricensus, which is part of <a href="http://regina.sourceforge.net">Regina</a>
